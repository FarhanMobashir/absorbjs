Hello Everyone 👋. In this blog we will have a quick walkthrough of our favourite language which is JavaScript. Just kidding 😁. In programming and computer science there is nothing like a favourite language or a boring language. Programming language are just there so that we can interact with the computer and solve problems. And whatever works for our use case is ofcourse the best language in that condition.

Enough of boring lectures, now it's time to learn something about javascript.

```js
console.log("Hello world");
